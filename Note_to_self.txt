Note-to-self 

1. Hyperspectral imaging values are wavelength? 
2. Jupyter Notebook can't find package use: 
            import sys #https://jakevdp.github.io/blog/2017/12/05/installing-python-packages-from-jupyter/
            !{sys.executable} -m pip install [package]

3. Find a way to mash together datasets. The data is 2d and the labels are 1d. 
4. Ways might work for decision tree: 
    - Change the labels for the data sets for one vs rest or 1v1. 
    - Change of the prorization of the classes. 
    - Make different models
    - Mash them together to one model or something.
